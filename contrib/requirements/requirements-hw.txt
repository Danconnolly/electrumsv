# Keepkey uses an unpinned protobuf version, but has older definitions. We need to pin protobuf to
# a compatible version to work without issue.
# - Protobuf 3.18.0 was used in 1.3.15 but Github noisily triggers dependabot alerts everytime
#   we push code referring to this. Our use of protobuf is limited to Keepkey, and not externally
#   accessible, so it's not really an issue but it is costing work to fend off these alerts.
# - Protobuf 3.18.3 is recommended by Github. But it core dumps on MacOS in our unit tests and
#   this is an indicator of instability at least on MacOS.
# - Protobuf 3.19.6 is the last release before 3.20, which is where the API seems to have broken.
#   It does not core dump on MacOS and testing including signing on Windows does not trigger the
#   broken API path.
protobuf==3.19.6
requests<=2.25.0
# NOTE(rt12): I literally have no idea the correct thing to do here. pip-tools has some concept
#     of unsafe stuff that is poorly documented and it generates hashes pip refuses to install on
#     some platforms but not others! Windows works fine, but MacOS does not. This is painful.
#     So here is the setuptools I have installed locally on Windows, because.. I do not know.
#     It is pinned to this version in all requirement files so that installing one does not
#     clash with another.
