# NOTE(rt12): I literally have no idea the correct thing to do here. pip-tools has some concept
#     of unsafe stuff that is poorly documented and it generates hashes pip refuses to install on
#     some platforms but not others! Windows works fine, but MacOS does not. This is painful.
#     So here is the setuptools I have installed locally on Windows, because.. I do not know.
#     It is pinned to this version in all requirement files so that installing one does not
#     clash with another.
