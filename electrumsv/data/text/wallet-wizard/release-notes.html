            Changes included in this version of ElectrumSV are documented in a more readable
            form within the following article: <a href="https://medium.com/@roger-taylor/electrumsv-1-3-12-a4002e6dbdf6">ElectrumSV 1.3.12</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            The most prominent changes are also summarised below for convenience, if you wish to read more
            about any given change, please read the linked article.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Memory leaks: If a user opened multiple wallets at the same time in ElectrumSV, closing the
            window for one wallet would not result in it being garbage collected. The wallet itself and
            the accounts however, would have been closed properly.</li>
          <li>Payments: The default value for the "use change" setting was lost, and instead of
            being "True" defaulted to "False". This would only happen for new wallets created since
            this regression happened in the 1.3.11 release.</li>
          <li>Wallet reliability: It is no longer possible to open wallets created with a later version
            of ElectrumSV than you are using. Rather than potentially erroring or introducing corruption
            a user friendly error message is shown.</li>
