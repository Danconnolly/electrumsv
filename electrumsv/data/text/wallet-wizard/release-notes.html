        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reliability: Fixed a long time bug in the transaction caching which would in very rare
            circumstances cause errors when transactions were evicted from the cache to make room for
            more recently loaded ones.</li>
          <li>Transaction loading: The loading from file dialog filtered for the '.txn' extension and
            now it offers a range of filters including '*.json', '*.txt' and the open '*.*'.</li>
          <li>Scaling testnet: The checkpoint for the scaling testnet was out of date and prevented using
            existing builds for that blockchain. Now the checkpoint has been removed, and any build
            from this one on should never have this problem again.</li>
          <li>Documentation: Extended the 'verify your download' guide with information on how to verify
            the GPG signatures on MacOS.</li>
          <li>Web site: An article on how to access the scaling testnet (STN) with ElectrumSV has
            been added.
          </li>
