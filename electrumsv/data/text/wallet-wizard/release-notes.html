            The most prominent changes are also summarised below for convenience, if you wish to read more
            about any given change, please read the linked article.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Security:</b> Due to the packages we depend on, we bundle the root certificates that are used
            to verify that when we connect to a web site it is the legitimate web site. One of these
            certificates was revoked, and we need to do a release to provide a version of the wallet
            that does not contain that revoked certificate. The version of the `certifi` package we
            include has been updated.</li>
            <li><b>User interface:</b> There seems to be a bug where restoring a wallet would leave the history
            tab list of transactions not correctly updated. Specifically, the dates would still show
            "Unknown" despite the transaction having been verified as in a block with the merkle proof.
            It should have been updated with the date of the block. A workaround was added to force
            an update, but the whole model seems to need a rewrite however the current focus is on the
            1.4 release.</li>
            <li><b>User friendliness:</b> We do not include all the past blockchain headers with the wallet, and
            before the wallet can work properly it used to download all the headers. Nowadays we have
            built-in checkpointing so that we can fetch the headers we need on demand, and not require
            that long startup time. In order to make this release more user-friendly, we have updated
            the mainnet and testnet header checkpoints.</li>
            <li><b>Documentation:</b> The documentation covering how to verify your download with our PGP signatures
            referred to a different file suffix ".sig" for the file signatures rather than ".asc" which
            the tooling appears to have switched to, causing user confusion. This has now been aligned
            with the tooling, and uses ".asc".</li>
            <li><b>Technical debt (Python language):</b> The Python standard library has provided a range of useful
            hashing functionality out of the box. One of these, RIPEMD-160, is used in Bitcoin primarily
            for things like public key hashes (as used in P2PKH addresses) and script hashes (as used
            in the past in P2SH addresses). The Python support for RIPEMD-160 comes from the support for
            it in the OpenSSL library. With the removal of it from OpenSSL 3, it is also no longer
            available in Python and ElectrumSV errors when it tries to access it. We now bundle a giant
            hack that intercepts Python language RIPEMD-160 usage in both ElectrumSV and in our `bitcoinx`
            dependency and reroutes it through Cryptodomex (which we include anyway and is primarily used
            to speed up AES encryption/decryption).</li>
            <li><b>Technical debt (Github):</b> Github helpfully notifies us when any of the packages we depend on
            have security issues. A lot of these issues do not affect us in meaningful ways, but Github
            cannot tell this and continually "not-spams" us about them every time it sees any activity.
            In order to reduce the pain of using Github it requires that we update those packages
            regardless.
                <ul>
                <li>Protobuf was updated. This is package is a nuisance with numerous problems. There's a
                security issue that does not effect us in 3.18.0, the version we previously used. But the
                recommendation was to update to 3.18.3, and this crashed on MacOS. 3.20 and above breaks
                backwards compatibility and we cannot use it because it is not our dependency, but that of
                a third party (keepkey). So we settled on 3.19.6, which is the latest release before the
                break in backwards compatibility and does not crash on MacOS.</li>
                <li>Setuptools was updated.</li>
                </ul>
